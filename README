## Compilation
Used usual method for compilation
Tested on gl43.student.cs

## Manual
### How to run
in the root folder:
premake4 gmake
make
cd src
premake4 gmake
make

###Objectives
Objective pictures are in src/Generated/Objectives
1. Support ray tracing for extra primitives (Cylinder, Torus) 

2. Refraction using Snell’s law 

3. Glossy refraction averaging perturbance of the refracted ray 

4. Reflection using Snell’s law 

5. Glossy reflection by averaging perturbance of the surface normal 

6. Soft shadows by sending multiple shadow rays 

7. Texture Mapping is added to certain surfaces 

8. Super sampling is used for anti-aliasing 

9. Keyframe animation using Bezier curves is used to animate characters 

10. Render a final scene that showcases objectives 

## stupid mistakes I made (for own record)
1. Set glm matrix manually, but glm matricies are aligned differently
2. forgetting to normalize directions
3. using .length() instead of glm length
4. unsigned int underflow
5. setting pixel color then comparing
6. not paying attention to data type and used int
7. animation transformations come -first-
